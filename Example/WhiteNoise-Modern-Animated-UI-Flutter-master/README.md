  - AnimatedIcons

# Principle of Animation

The whole app is divided into 2 sections - left & right and each of them in further 3 sub sections- top, middle & bottom. Hence its divided into 6 total sections.

Every component is placed within appropriate sections and then these sections changes shape and size as per action. It might look that not much is going on but, it is. Look for subtle animations.

Audio Player section also animates according to expansion & collapsing action of its section.

Stream & Block triggers the animation in real-time and also updates the UI accordingly.

# About Me

Hi! my name is Akash Divya.

I'm a veteran Designer/Animator with **10+ years** of experience. I always hated the excuses Developers gave me when they fail to implement my Design. One day, when I found about Flutter I said no more & started learning it.
