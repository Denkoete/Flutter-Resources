# For information on the generic Dart part of this file, see the

# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true
  assets:
    - images/
    - images/placeholder.png
    # - storage/emulated/0
    

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #  - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: GIcons
      fonts:
        - asset: font/GIcons.ttf
    - family: GCIcon
      fonts:
        - asset: font/GCIcon.ttf
    - family: Flutter_0824_icons
      fonts:
        - asset: font/Flutter_0824_icons.ttf 
    - family: Flutter_0917_icons
      fonts:
        - asset: font/Flutter_0917_icons.ttf 
    - family: MyFlutterApp
      fonts:
        - asset: font/MyFlutterApp.ttf
    - family: Flutter_1101
      fonts:
        - asset: font/Flutter_1101.ttf
    - family: HelveticaNeue
      fonts:
        - asset: font/helveticalNeue/HelveticaNeue.ttf          
        - asset: font/helveticalNeue/HelveticaNeueMedium.ttf
          weight: 300        
        - asset: font/helveticalNeue/HelveticaNeueLight.ttf
          weight: 100        
    # - family: HelveticaNeue
    #   fonts:
    #     - asset: fonts/HelveticaNeue.ttf

  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
